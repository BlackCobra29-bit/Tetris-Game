# Tetris Game with Python and Pygame

Welcome to the Tetris Game project! This repository contains a fully functional Tetris game built with Python and Pygame. Tetris is a popular tile-matching puzzle game that has been recreated here for anyone to play and modify using Python.

## Introduction

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Tetris game using the Pygame library. The goal of the game is to rotate and position falling tetrominoes (blocks) to complete horizontal lines. Once a line is completed, it disappears, and the player earns points. The game speeds up as more lines are cleared, providing an exciting and challenging gameplay experience.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay that mimics the original mechanics.
- Smooth graphics and animations powered by Pygame.
- Increasing difficulty as more lines are cleared.
- Customizable game settings like screen size and block colors in the code.
- Game over detection and a score display.

## Prerequisites
Before running this game, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library 

```bash 
pip install pygame
```

## Installation

To install and run the Tetris game on your local machine, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository by running:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BlackCobra29-bit/Tetris-Game.git
```

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to fit falling tetrominoes into complete horizontal lines. When a line is completed, it disappears, and you score points. The game becomes progressively harder as more lines are cleared.

## Game Controls
- **Left Arrow**: Move the tetromino left
- **Right Arrow**: Move the tetromino right
- **Up Arrow**: Rotate the tetromino
- **Down Arrow**: Increase the speed of the falling tetromino
- **Spacebar**: Drop the tetromino immediately to the bottom
